The purpose of the fast config repo is to quickly set up a distro after fresh install of the os.
I have made folders each named after the OS they are meant to be run on. 
Inside of each folder there are files that are named in the following way for fast understanding and quick use:
    - *.txt         (BADusb scripts written in duckyscript meant to run on the Flipper-zero)
    - *.js          (JavaScript files that are meant to be run on the Flipper-zero)
    - sh/bat/...    (Files that are meant to be downloaded and run on the operating system in question.)
